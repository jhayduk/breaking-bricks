Ball

The Ball is a GameElement starts the game at the starting position. When a
a start button is pressed it then starts falling in a semi-random direction
and then can bounce off of the paddle, the top and side of the screen and the
bricks. If the ball hits a brick, it bounces off of it, but the brick "breaks"
and disappears. If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen, it resets to
the starting position.

A Ball is a subclass of GameElement, which means it is updatable and
drawable on the game screen.

A Ball has x and y positions (as well as the topleft, bottom, etc. variables
because it is ultimately a subclass of Rect) and a velocity.

The x and y positions are always defined in pixels and refer to the top left
corner of the image. The x and y values are always relative to the top left
corner of the game screen itself, which is defined to be at x=0, y=0.

The velocity is a Vector2 value in pixels per millisecond (ppm), with a unit
vector pointing 1 ppm to the right and 1 ppm down (â†˜).

Although the game starts with a single ball, this class is NOT designed as a
singleton, allowing for the possibility of multiple balls in future updates.

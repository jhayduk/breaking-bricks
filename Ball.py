Ball

The Ball is a GameElement starts the game at the starting position. When a
a start button is pressed it then starts falling in a semi-random direction
and then can bounce off of the paddle, the top and side of the screen and the
bricks. If the ball hits a brick, it bounces off of it, but the brick "breaks"
and disappears. If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen, it resets to
the starting position.

A Ball is a subclass of GameElement, which means it is updatable and
drawable on the game screen.

A Ball has x and y positions (as well as the topleft, bottom, etc. variables
because it is ultimately a subclass of Rect) and a velocity.

The x and y positions are always defined in pixels and refer to the top left
corner of the image. The x and y values are always relative to the top left
corner of the game screen itself, which is defined to be at x=0, y=0.

The velocity is a Vector2 value in pixels per millisecond (ppm), with a unit
vector pointing 1 ppm to the right and 1 ppm down (â†˜).

Although the game starts with a single ball, this class is NOT designed as a
singleton, allowing for the possibility of multiple balls in future updates.

        The ball can collide with the paddle, or one (or more) of the bricks.
        The reaction is always the same. The ball will reflect in the
        direction of the edge that was collided with, and the ball will gain
        a portion of the x velocity of the object it collided with. Since
        bricks are stationary, this means that only the paddle will modify
        the x velocity of the ball.

        Everytime the ball hits an object, it speeds up slightly. This makes
        the game more challenging as time goes on.

        To avoid the ball getting "stuck" on a surface, move it so that the
        edge that hit is one pixel from colliding. This will give the
        appearance of the ball hitting without risking getting stuck.

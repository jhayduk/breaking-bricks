## About
This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic arcade game *Breakout*, originally developed by Atari. This version was created to explore game development using the *Pygame* library, and is intended for personal and educational use only. The code started with what was presented in the "Exploring Game Mechanics with Python by Example" class in Udemy by Penny de Byl, and then was refactored and adapted.

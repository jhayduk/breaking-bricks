Paddle

The Paddle is a GameElement moves back and forth near the bottom of screen and
is used to deflect the ball to both keep it in play and in an attempt to break
the bricks by bouncing the ball into them.

The Paddle is a subclass of GameElement, which means it is updatable and
drawable on the game screen.

It has x and y positions (as well as the topleft, bottom, etc. variables
because it is ultimately a subclass of Rect).

The x and y positions are always defined in pixels and refer to the top left
corner of the image. The x and y values are always relative to the top left
corner of the game screen itself, which is defined to be at x=0, y=0.

The velocity is a Vector2 value in pixels per millisecond (ppm), with a unit
vector pointing 1 ppm to the right and 1 ppm down (â†˜).

For the paddle, the velocity is always only in the x direction. For moving
the paddle itself, a velocity is not really needed. However, it is calculated
and updated so that it can be transferred to the ball when the ball is hit.
